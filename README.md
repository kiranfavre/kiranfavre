## What am I up to?
I am a recent graduate from the Bren School for Environmental Science & Management at University of California, Santa Barbara where I earned a Master of Environmental Data Science. While there, I worked on a capstone project with a group to improve our client's data infrastructure. We created an application that automates our client's data entry workflow, and a data visualization application using the R Shiny package. Before that, I recently earned my Bachelor of Environmental Sciences from University of California, Santa Cruz. 


### My interests
I am interested in data analysis and the use of technology to adress environmental problems. I want to contribute to knowledge surrounding climate mitigation while maintaining a focus on environmental justice. Outside of these interests, I enjoy hiking, meditation, and diving.
