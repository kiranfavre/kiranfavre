## What am I up to?
I am currently a Master of Environmental Data Science student at Bren School for Environmental Science & Management at University of California, Santa Barbara. I recently earned my Bachelor of Environmental Sciences from University of California, Santa Cruz. 


### My interests
I am interested in marine data visualization and climate change. I want to contribute to knowledge surrounding climate mitigation while maintaining a focus on environmental justice. Outside of class, I enjoy hiking, swimming at the beach, and diving.
